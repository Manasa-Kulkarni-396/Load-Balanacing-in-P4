# Load-Balanacing-in-P4
We will understand the how to balance the load with the help of P4 language. We are working on four industry algorithms.

## Industry Algorithms
We will be focusing on four algorithms which are in P4-language, namely:
1. Hash Load Balancing
2. Weighted Round-Robin Load Balancing
3. DPDK (Data Plane Developement Kit)
4. SHELL Load Balancing

## Install the required software
P4-Learning depends on the following software that needs to be installed before any exercises or example can be run. Please refer to these links to build and install it on your device.

- [PI](https://github.com/p4lang/PI)
- [Behavioral Model (BMv2)](https://github.com/p4lang/behavioral-model)
- [P4C](https://github.com/p4lang/p4c)
- [Mininet](http://mininet.org/)
- [P4-Utils](https://github.com/nsg-ethz/p4-utils)

A more detailed user guide on how to start with P4-Learning is available in the Wiki. It contains helpful information about the dependencies and the installation process. Moreover, you will find also instructions on how to use the virtual machine that we provide, so that the cumbersome installation of the various components can be skipped and you can directly start learning P4!
